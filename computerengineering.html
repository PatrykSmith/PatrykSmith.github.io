<h1 style = "padding-left:15px;"> Computer Engineering </h1>
<p style="padding: 15px;"> Computer Engineering is a more recent hobbie and interest of mine. I took an online computer class at <a href = "http://www.codecademy.com">Codecademy.com</a> and finsihed most of the courses on there. I also like to build things so robotics and electrical engineering became a fun hobbie to do as well. I took some online course and learned stuff and things. Now I am working on the robotic wheelchair found <a href = "/schoolprojects.html">here</a> and made this website using skills and technique I have leanerd through my time doing this sort of stuff.</p>
<p style="padding: 15px;"> I also built a couple of computers: one out of wood and spare parts of an old server and the other out of recycle parts of an old pc. they both run a version of windows and can dual boot into Ununtu.</p>
