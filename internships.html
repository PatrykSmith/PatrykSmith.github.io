<p class = "PiercingWordIntro"> At my highschool they offer internship opportunities. I have the opportunity to work for an organzation called Piercing Word. We are a non-for-profit organization whose motive is to igntite passion for the Word of God in the heart of the Church. We accomplish that through dramatic and muscial presentation of the Word of God, verbatim in the ESV translation of the Holy Bible. The organizaion was founded by Aaron House, Executive Director. If you want more information about Piercing Word and the opportunities they bring, click <a href = "http://www.google.com" style ="text-decoration: none">here!</a> There are also resources and a video below more about my internship and the process I had to go through to get it, and still am going through.</p>
