<h1 style = "padding:15px">Audio Engineering</h1>
<p> My audio engineering career started when I was in 5th grade. At my church, Gateway Community Grave Chuch, located in Parkesburg Pennsylvania, they have an organization called 5-Alive. It is a leadership oriented team of 5th grade students that want to serve and spread the Good News of Jesus Christ at a young age. I joined the group and we met every 3rd Sunday after our second service which started at 10:30 at the time, to do service projects. Each month we were assinged a job to help out with. I started with Presentations. I sat a the projectionist comptuer (a projectionsist is the peroson that puts the lyrics and slides up on stage so everyone can see) and I enjoyed it for the month. </p>
<p> After I did my time at the end of the month, we picked new jobs, and I picked to help with sound. Now I get that being a 5th grader and wanting to work with technology and being eager to help can lead to exagerations and such. So doing sound at the time I worked on a Mackie 8 channel powered mixer and ran the cd player for music and put a microphone up every once in a while. I was hot stuff. The board had like 50 buttons and knobs on it and I was definietly the cool kid that knew how to work it. NOT! I remember thinking wow this is cool and then one of the techs at church at the time showed me the "big boy" board they use for the main service. I was blown away. </p>
<p> So I started doing main service at the end of 6th grade. It was totally awesome. I worked on another Mackie model, the SLX 24-4, and they also had a SLX 16-4. I was the dog diggity then. I worked on that board till 9th grade and then agter we upgraded to the digital age. One of my mentors, Kyle Gerheart, installed the Beringer X32. Now I was pro! Psyche. I worked on that board for a while, still up to today sometimes. And I worked on a number of other boards too.</p>
<p> At school I started my sound journey in the middle of 6th grade working on an old jankie board, I beleive it was an early QSC model. Anyways, I helped out with tech crew and stage crew at West Fallowfield Chrisitan School till the end of 8th grade. I come back sometimes to help with banquets and other events like talent shows. They now have an updated version of the Mackie SLX 16-4 board. Then onto High School.</p>
<p> Freshman year was fun! I attended Lancaster Mennonite High School. They had a Soundcraft MH3 board and Presonus ACP88's, a i208 Clair Bothers Full array set. The. Whole. Nine. Yards. I really expanded my knoweledge and expertise there. I did stage crew and tech crew there too. I was under the command of the amazing Mitchel Steffy and Zane Harnish and Ryan Rohrer. Ryan owned a side business doing gigs for churches and stuff and I was good enough to help him out with it, he used a Presonus StudioLive 16 board with a complete Presonus rig. It was ridiculous. They were a good crew. Then I went to Pequea Valley High School.</p>
<p> After attending LMH I was like there can't be another school with better equipment. And Although PVHS isn't the most prominent figure in terms of tech, they have a great Apple affiliated program and some decent tech in the auditorium. So at PVHS I end my high school career. There I used an Allen and Heath GL3800 and the same ACP88's as LMH. During this time I also worked for another Organization called Piericng Word as an intern, you can find more information about that <a href="/internships.html" style = "text-decoration: none; text-decoration-color: none" >here.</a> I have done more than 200 shows in my 7 years. And love Audio Engineering. I plan to go to College for Computer Engineering but Minoring in Audio Engineering.</p>
